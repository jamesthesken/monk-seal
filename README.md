# MonkSeal
Encrypted peer to peer messaging application written in Go.

This is both an educational project and something I hope could be useful for an actual application.

## High-level Goals:
1. Use p2p technology.
2. Encrypt messages between senders.
3. Make a friendly interface.
4. ???
5. Profit

## Thank you!
